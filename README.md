This is an early work in progress ARM cpu emulator with the hopes of one day being a functioning
Nintendo DS emulator. 

The primary goal for this project is to learn about and implement a functioning CPU emulator using
just-in-time recompilation (also called dynamic binary translation, among other things) to translate
code from ARM machine code to x86_64 machine code at runtime. It's also provided a great excuse 
to learn Rust!
